# git 

Git is a version control system that helps track changes in code and collaborate with others. Repositories are projects and branches are different versions of the repository. Private repositories can be created for sensitive or personal projects. Branching allows working on different aspects of the project without affecting the main line of development. Merging combines changes from different branches and prefix descriptors like feat or bugfix can be used in commit messages to indicate the type of changes made.

# object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts

OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming, which is a programming model that organizes software design around objects rather than functions and logic [8]. Objects are data structures that have unique attributes and behaviors[7]. OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them[8].


## inheritance
- **Inheritance** is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit or reuse the properties and methods of another class. The class that inherits is called a subclass or child class, and the class that is inherited from is called a superclass or parent class [2] [3] [5].

## Polymorphism
- **Polymorphism** is a feature that allows an object to behave differently depending on the context or situation. For example, a single method can have different implementations in different subclasses, or an object can be treated as an instance of different classes[3][4][6].

## encapsulation
- **Encapsulation** is a technique that hides the internal details and state of an object from the outside world. It also restricts access to certain parts of an object by using access modifiers such as public, private, protected, etc. Encapsulation helps to maintain data integrity and security[2][3][4].


## abstraction
- **Abstraction** is a process of simplifying complex reality by modeling only the relevant aspects of a problem. Abstraction helps to reduce complexity and increase efficiency by focusing on what an object can do rather than how it does it[4][5].
